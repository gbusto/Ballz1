        Maybe rewrite this function to accept an array as the parameter for easier testing?
        Also, maybe separate the visual logic of moving the balls to the origin point into the view.
        I think it'll make testing easier if I separate all the logic that does anything visually into the view file and keep all of this other logic as non-view. I think it'll make everything more testable and then I can even run through game scenarios more quickly than if I needed to have the game view up.

            ball manager on the ground (which the game would record as a collision) and the chain of events would fire and all
            balls in the BallManager's list would end up in the stoppedBalls list. When firing balls for the first time, it would
            process that list (in handleStoppedBalls) and tell them to stop and return to their origin point.
            This fixes that bug by ensuring that the stoppedBalls list is empty when starting to shoot balls.
