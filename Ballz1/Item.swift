    // Arguments:
    //   - num: A number to append to a name; used in collision dectection to tell what item was hit
    //   - size: Size of the item (circles will just use size.width as a radius
    //   - position: Where to position the node on the screen

    // Returns nothing

    // This function checks to see if the item should be removed from the item array in the generator and handles anything to be done before it removes the item from the scene; use this function for any animation before the item is removed
    //
    // Returns true if the item should be removed; false otherwise
